# Reverse-string
Reversing a string after dividing the string into two sub strings


Given a string S of size N (N is always even) where each element is a character, divide S into two sub-strings of size N/2 each. Then form a new string by alternatively combining the characters of the two sub-strings in reverse order. Print the reversed string as the output.

Constraints:
i) N >= 2
ii) There should be no special symbols or spaces in the input strings
iii) S can contain either lowercase or uppercase letters or a mix of both

Input format:
The input contains a string S

Output format:
The output should contain a reversed string

Example:
-- Input: HelloWorld
   Output: odlllreoHW
